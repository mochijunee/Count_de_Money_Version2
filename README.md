My revisions:
1. I added the document language (html lang="en")
2. Changed the color and styling of my buttons to make it better for users' vision and thumbs/mouse
3. Changed the structure and organization
4. Added instructions to the website
5. Added a "back to top" button so that users can easily access all parts of the page when needed
